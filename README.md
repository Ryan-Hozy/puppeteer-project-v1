This project demonstrates how to use Puppeteer in conjunction with Node.js to automate web interactions and extract data from a sample website. The script performs various tasks such as navigating to a webpage, extracting text and image data, interacting with page elements, and saving data to local files. Additionally, it uses node-cron to schedule the script to run at regular intervals.
